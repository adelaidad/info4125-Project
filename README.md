## Group 9 INFO 4125 Project

### Project Overview

Our project tackles the challenge of finding convenient and health-conscious dining options on campus that accommodate diverse dietary needs and restrictions. Targeting Cornell students, our goal is to simplify meal selection, promote healthier eating habits, and enhance campus dining operations through personalized meal recommendations.

We’ve developed an application that integrates real-time data from Cornell Dining’s NetNutrition system, delivering customized meal suggestions based on individual nutritional goals, dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, low-calorie, high-protein), and specific restrictions (e.g., allergens). Unlike existing platforms such as Eatery, which simply lists menus without customization, or MyFitnessPal, which focuses solely on macro counting, our solution innovates by combining location-specific Cornell dining data with a fully customizable system. This personalized approach encourages balanced eating while addressing ethical considerations, such as dietary inclusivity and allergen information accuracy.
